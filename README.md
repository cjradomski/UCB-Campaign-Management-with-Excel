# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
In this analysis, we are helping Louise, an up-and-coming playwrite, determine the parameters for fundraising for her play Fever.
In order to assist Louise, we:
  1. Filtered data from Kickstarter to determine data set for theater and plays
  2. Created various tables and graphs to visualize the relationship of campaign outcomes to different strata
  3. Made recommendations on what parameters to make when making a campaign for a play
### Challenge
In this analysis, "Outcomes Based on Goals" and "Outcomes based on Launch Date" were analyzed to determine recommendations for goal setting and when to launch a campaign. <br />  
<br />"Kickstarter Campaign Analysis" is the report detailing the findings and conclusions of the analysis <br />
<br />"Outcomes Based on Goal" - located in the images folder - is the line graph demonstrating the relationship of outcomes and goal amounts <br />
<br />"Outcomes Based on Launch Date Monthly" - located in the images folder - is the line graph demonstrating the relationship of outcomes and months for campaigns during the years 2009 through 2017. <br />
<br />"data-1-1-3-StarterBook Kickstarter Analysis" is the excel file where the analysis was performed including the raw data as well as the other analyses performed prior to the challenge.
